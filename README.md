* Context

- education
- default (has credit in default? 'no','yes','unknown')

* About current campaign:
- contact (communication type: 'cellular','telephone')
- duration (last contact duration, in seconds) Important note: the duration attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the - - duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark - - purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

- month (last contact month of year)
- campaign (number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client)
